title: About
---

I am currently living in South West Japan, in Itoshima, Fukuoka. Its a beautiful calm place surrounded by mountains, forests, sea, and locally grown organic veggies!

I am working full-time on full-stack Haskell development work which is mostly all open-source.

I am vegetarian and cook almost all of my meals.

Previously I had experience of working on `vcs` Verilog simulator
