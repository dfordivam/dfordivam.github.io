title: About
---

I am currently living in Japan, in a small town call Ainan. Its a beautiful calm place surrounded by mountains, forests and sea. I like to take a stroll along the river just 100m from my home.

I am doing full-time open-source Haskell development thanks to the sponsorship of my employer [Blue Impact](http://www.blueimpact.co.jp/en/)!

Previously I had experience of working on performance improvements of `vcs` Verilog simulator
